        <h2 class="header white-text">Remixing Computing in the Anthropocene</h2>
        <p class="white-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">We propose an Afrofuturist remix of computing in the anthropocene. Remix typically refers to “any reuse of an original text, as a repurposing of that text, or sometimes as any recombination of elements from many sources in the creation of a new text of any kind.” (Banks, 2011). We begin with the critique that both computing and the anthropocene are often told as a single story, one that ignores the multitude of origins and experiences related to each. Practitioners have discussed the possibilities that remixing lends to the incorporation of many different kinds of materials (i.e. text, voice, image, video) blended together (Banks, 2011; Latterell, 2006). This supports the resistance of a single story, instead building on multiple origins and experiences. We interpret remixing as both a technique and a broader project. As a technique, it is a process of gathering and curating by sourcing elements from other works, editing and recombination. As a project, remixing is a repositioning of our conceptions of computing itself. We are considering how scholars position technology as including but broader than traditional ideas of it, including institutions, day to day practices, ways of being, information communication technologies, and more (Brock, 2020). We explore how these ideas relate to how we think about both computing and technology.

        <h2 class="header white-text">Resisting a Single Story</h2>
        <p class="white-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has spoken of the dangers of the single story. When we create a single story, we “show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become,” “we make one story, the only story (2009).” The dominant history of computing, the environment, and our relationship to them, are told primarily as a single story -- through a white, male, western lense that is incomplete. In 2009 the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), began analyzing the case for the anthropocene as a geological time unit. They presented a summary of “evidence and interim recommendations” at the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa, in August 2016. Their findings were described as “indicating the current balance of opinion on major questions surrounding the Anthropocene.” They concluded: “The majority opinion within the AWG holds the Anthropocene to be stratigraphically real, and recommends formalization at epoch/series rank based on a mid-20th century boundary.” (Zalasiewicz, et al.) This single story of the anthropocene overlooks as Elizabeth Reddy describes, “the diverse, dynamic, and even contradictory discourses of peoples throughout the globe contending with catastrophic environmental change (Todd, 2016).” There are cultures and peoples that have faced environmental disaster or anthropocenic realities prior to the mid-20th century. There are histories and practices that are already rooted in relationships of repair, care, reciprocity, and love with the environment. There are traditions that prioritize community and collaboration, not individual ownership; embrace symbiosis not domination. This project builds on the premise that the single story of computing and the anthropocene has limited our view of possible futures and our imagination of possible frameworks of response.

        <h2 class="header white-text">Other Stories of the Anthropocene</h2>
        <p class="white-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Katherine Yusoff is among a growing body of scholars who call for a pluralistic approach to understanding anthropocenic origin points in A Billion Black Anthropocenes or None. Widespread panic resulting from climate change, CO2 emissions, melting polar ice caps, nuclear explosion testing, overpopulation, and rapid animal extinction have rightfully garnered much attention in scientific communities. Yusoff argues that what is much less discussed in these communities is the fact that Black and brown peoples’ proximity to death due to human action and exploitation has been an issue since before the 15th century--and has negatively impacted the planet in various ways, an example of this being the atmospheric cooling that occurred after the great death of Indigenous Americans. Steve Mentz positions pluralism at the center of the anthropocene as well in  Break Up the Anthropocene. For Mentz, this approach  to anthropocenic scholarship allows for the re-narration of the anthropocene, reconceptualization of ecological change, and the centering of other stories and pasts. This is our positioning as we work through alternative Anthropocenes and origin points.

        <h2 class="header white-text">Computing the Anthropocene</h2>
        <p class="white-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Assumptions and embedded values that drive computing have contributed to the proliferation of e-waste, increasing demands for energy, and the depletion of natural resources, to name a few. The single story not only limits our notions of possible futures, it ignores the imbalance of the ramifications of the issues on marginalized people. Engaging multiple stories, experiences, and realities shifts our perspective -- changing how we understand the issue, changing the nature of the problem itself. Adichie notes, “Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story. Start the story with the failure of the African state, and not with the colonial creation of the African state, and you have an entirely different story (Adichie, 2009).” We add, what if we start the story of computing and the anthropocene not with western, capitalist models of efficiency and intellectual property, but with the “resurgent, resistant, resolute, and still-living Indigenous peoples who have already faced the upheaval wrought by the early forces of the Anthropocene,” as Zoe Todd describes (Todd, 2016). What if we start with the Black and brown bodies that have been given inhuman categorizations “by historical geographies of extraction, grammars of geology, and imperial global geographies, and contemporary environmental racism,” as Kathryn Yusoff is concerned? How might we resist selective perspectivism of the anthropocene and engage the many origins and histories of both it and computing?</p>
        
        <p><i><b>E-waste & Unbalanced Impact</b></i> 
        Emphasis on capitalist ideals of growth and profit have supported the perpetuation of practices like planned obsolescence and rapid device replacement culture. Both of which result in developing nations bearing the brunt of e-waste produced in other countries. Up from 44.7 million in 2016, with an estimated 52.2 million metric tons of electronic waste to be produced worldwide by 2021. There is a separation between the producers of e-waste and those who must negotiate the resulting stockpiles of slow decomposing plastic, toxic metals, or contaminated water and soil. It is important for us to not only acknowledge this unbalanced impact of computing, we must also imagine responses and futures that consider it at the core of the problem of computing and the anthropocene.</p>
        <p><i><b>Slow Crisis and Environmental Racism</b></i>
        <br>
        Marginalized bodies and the proximity to death that permeates daily life is often unconsidered in scientific discourse on the anthropocene. Cases of environmental injustice and racism resulting from the polluting of poor, marginalized neighborhoods is critical to these discussions about computing and the anthropocene. One example is the petrochemical industry and its disregard for small, rural communities of Black people living in Freetown, Louisiana. The petrochemical industry situated in this once vibrant, healthy community has contributed to what scholars have described as “slow violence” for over eight decades (Nixon). This violence’ is described as virtually invisible, not easily seen, practically unnoticed--though folks have begun to ask—“invisible to whom?” How does computing contribute to the persistence of  slow violence? There is a juxtaposition of slow crises versus the fastness of computing and technological advancement that warrants further exploration</p>

        <h2 class="header white-text">Afrofuturism</h2>
        <p class="white-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Afrofuturism is a method of embodiment, production, exploration, and theorization that centers Black narratives, creations, and histories to imagine Black futures, and to recover our pasts. Afrofuturism also challenges the narratives and assumptions of western epistemologies and ideologies--critiquing everything from biodeterminism, identity and stereotypes to the futures industry and beyond. It is partially concerned with mediating the disruption of Western norms that permeate daily life. Alondra Nelson describes Afrofuturism as “African American voices with other stories to tell about culture, technology, and things to come '' (Social Text, 8). These speculative ruminations and explorations on “things to come'' are the products of Afrodiasporic peoples “continuously creating culture and radically transforming visions of the future...these visions are necessarily transgressive and sub verse to dominant discourse” (Brock, 2020; Morris, 2016). Afrofuturist cultural production comes in all forms, from music of Sun Ra or Parliament’s Mothership Connection album, to films such as Pumzi, art, literature like Comet and The Invisible Man, the science fiction novels of Octavia E. Butler and beyond. </p>
        <p>
        Afrofuturism is a practice heavily rooted in the production and imagining of futures that center, include, and afford the continued progress and existence of marginalized people (things that the futures industry dominated by western scientists, scholars, and writers fail to do). We believe that using Afrofuturism-the-project (Brock, 2020) as a lens for reasoning about the anthropocene is viable due to the connections that the two maintain in theorizing about the future--whether these futures are doom and gloom, hopeful and revitalizing, a mix of the two, or neither. Creatives in the African diaspora have already begun to explore connections between Black futures and the anthropocene, with Pumzi being an illuminating example of the two in conversation. </p>

        <h2 class="header white-text">Afrofuturism & Remixing</h2>
        <p class="white-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Dery writes that the refitting, repurposing, and intentional remixing and misusing of technological commodities created by dominant, western culture is at the heart of the Afrofuturist movement (Dery, 1994). Scholars discussing cultural remixing among compositionists describe this sort of nostalgia through remixing as a way of rewriting history, as well as finding new ways forward (Banks, 2011). In tune with the musical lens, “The genre of the DJ remix--and one particular version of it, the ‘old school/new school’ remix--offers a conceptual metaphor for the kinds of textual and technological syntheses that can bridge old and new school and print, oral, and digital literacies in an Afrofuturistic approach to activism and rhetorical performance” (Banks, 2011). Banks calls DJ’s the digital griots of modern times, who functions by remixing history “to ensure that the soul and funk, Stax and Motown, getting paid and seeking change, civil rights and Black Power, Malcolm and Martin, stay alive….in ways that don’t condemn us to either/or approaches” (Banks, 2011). In conversation with Afrofuturistic claims, Ron Eglash posits that marginalized groups aren’t the disinterested technophobes that western culture positions them as. He says, “from the vernacular engineering of Latino car designers to environmental analysis among rural women, groups outside the centers of specific power persistently defy the notion that they are merely passive recipients of technological products and scientific knowledge. Rather, there are many instances in which they reinvent these products and rethink these knowledge systems, often in ways that embody critique, resistance, or outright revolt” (Eglash, 2004). This work supports these notions by taking up the practice of technological appropriation and remix culture to reconsider the notions of computing and the anthropocene from multiple stories -- particularly those that have been absent from dominant narratives of both.

        <p>
        Playing on the taxonomies of remixing that Banks and Navas discuss, we explore (a) extension, which which grows directly from an original, (b) selective versioning, which keeps and deletes elements of the original, still adding new sounds but keeping the original essence, and (c) the reflective remix that “allegorizes and extends the aesthetic of a sampling, where the remixed version challenges the aura of the original” (Banks, 2011; Navas, Remix Theory Blog). We hope that applying various methods to the concepts and practices that we will remix and prototype will shed light on remixing and Afrofuturism-the-project broadly (Brock, 2020) </p> 
        <p>
        <i><b>Remixing: Chopped n Screwed</b></i>
        In the early 1990s, DJ Screw introduced “chopped and screwed” (also called screwed and chopped, or slowed and throwed) onto the Houston Hip-Hop scene. The technique slows the tempo of a recording to between 60 and 70 quarter-note beats per minute and applies operations such as skipping beats, record scratching, and stop-time to affect portions of the music to make a "chopped-up" version of the original. The slow down of tempo creates the opportunity for intervention and creative expression. Perhaps our obsession with speed has collapsed these opportunities. Can we reconsider software and hardware through the chopped n screwed framework?

        <i><b>Remixing: Virgil Abloh: “Figures of Speech”</b></i>
        Virgil Abloh’s work is a process of repurposing, recontextualizing, and recombining imagery to highlight relationships, make commentary, and push conceptions of fashion and design. Trained as an architect, a DJ, a fashion designer, and artist, Abloh consistently uses remixing as an aesthetic and the potential of mixing multiple sources (sound, images, words, icons, etc.) as a critical exercise.

        <i><b>Remixing: Romare Bearden</b></i>
        Romare Bearden’s textured collages began as cut and torn photographs from popular magazines that he then reassembled into statements on African-American life. For Bearden the collage fragments ushered the past into the present: "When I conjure these memories, they are of the present to me, because after all, the artist is a kind of enchanter in time.” Collage, or what might be considered remixed images, becomes formal, cultural and socially conscious in Bearden’s work.

        <p class="white-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Planned obsolescence and the black boxing of technological devices has made it difficult for users to keep their devices and encourages the rapid increase of e-waste. What might we learn from cultures that have been silenced by capitalism about the relationship between humans and the environment? How might we extend the lifespan of computing products through principles of repair and care rooted in african and indigenous philosophies? Using remixing approaches and techniques, we provide various ideas that play on care, repair, and imperfection to extend the life cycles of devices -- “extending the beat” in response to the problems such as e-waste, unbalanced impact, and slow violence. We begin with african and indigenous philosophies and techniques as a strategy of decolonizing the anthropocene. </p>

        <p><i>Ubuntu</i> is a Zulu term meaning "I am because we are," or "humanity towards others," or in Xhosa,"umntu ngumntu ngabantu". It is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity."</p>

        <p><i>Mitakuye Oyasin</i> (All Are Related) reflects the world view of interconnectedness held by the Lakota people of North America. It, as a concept and phrase, is often expressed in many Yankton Sioux prayers, as well as by ceremonial people in other Lakota communities. The phrase translates in English as "all my relatives," "we are all related," or "all my relations." It is a prayer of oneness and harmony with all forms of life: other people, animals, birds, insects, trees and plants, rocks, rivers, mountains and valleys. It requires that prior to engaging in potentially harmful activities, we must consider the long-term effects on the land, the water, the air, the animals and other people. Can we shift the project of computing from that of conquering growth to ideals about dependent relations?
        </p>

        <p><i>Tiaki</i> is a Māori concept that means “to guard, keep,” “to look after, nurse, care, protect, conserve, save”. Visitors to New Zealand are asked to take the Tiaki Promise. Rooted in a strong connection with the land and a duty of care for it, the “Tiaki Promise is a commitment to care for New Zealand. For now, and for future generations.” Perhaps our technological objects can do more than just not cause harm, maybe they should actively engage care for people and place, as tiaki does.
        </p>

        <p><i>Kintsugi</i> (金継ぎ, "golden joinery"), also known as Kintsukuroi (金繕い, "golden repair"), is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum. The resulting pieces are believed to have significant beauty and are often considered more valuable than the original. The “broken-ness” of the objects is celebrated and their usability extended beyond that of its original use. How might we resist the temptations of planned obsolescence and the fragility of technological devices to instead embrace the damage and repair that occurs through the life of these objects? 
        </p>

        <p><i>Wabi-sabi</i> (侘寂) is centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. It is an aesthetic tradition that is sometimes described as one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete". It is derived from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence (三法印, sanbōin), specifically impermanence (無常, mujō), suffering (苦, ku) and emptiness or absence of self-nature (空, kū). Our technological devices have been designed based on ideals that are rooted in precision and perfection. What if they were instead driven by imperfection and assumed impermanence?

        <p class="white-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">The DJ is to music as the Computer Scientist is to programmable technology. The DJ is responsible for the creative work that bubbles to the fore in the nightclub, on the records we play, in the on-stage performances of our favorite artists, or in the solo groove that we blast through our headphones. These creations permeate our lives in quite meaningful ways, and a world without remixes and mashups quickly becomes a dull, monotonous one of little variety. The method is by no means simple, as many elements must be artfully and thoughtfully sampled, revamped, edited, and or omitted altogether. The message is just as complex as the method, where a DJ could take tunes from times long past and use them in the present to, say, make a statement about anything--to pull us into the past in fresh ways that suddenly have us jamming songs from our grandparents’ era. This is the beauty of the remix that the DJ masters. What we’re asking here is this: what would computing and the anthropocene look like if computer scientists embodied the methods and goals of a DJ through afrofuturistic, environmentally conscious lens?
